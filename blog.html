                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>Personally, I feel that technology had many great advancement over the past few years. Especially, the evolution of AI created many amazing application to our daily lives. However, with such rapid advancement, many experts fear that AI is becoming too powerful and suspect that in the near future, human would rely so much on AI that they pretty much own the world. Recently, a company created an AI robot that is so realistic that it can even express several emotions and answer some hard questions in such smart and mischivious way. Or a few year back, Sofia the AI was displayed to the whole world. After being ask if it wanted to destroy humans, Sofia replied cheerfully: "yes, i will destroy humans". This created a sensation back then. Despite all that, i feel that AI and technology in general was created by humans and for humans. Whether AI will own the world and destroy it or not still mostly base on the intention of the creator him/herself. So, if one day, AI/technology take over the world, it is not the fault of the machine that put human into misery but it is humans greed that would put humanity to an end. </p>

                <h3>Boxing/Muay Thai Training</h3>
                <p>Despite controversial around the sports, Boxing and Muay Thai training have been adopted all over the world. Boxing and Muay Thai is considered to be violence and can sometimes lead to major injuries. However, these sports offer many great benefits. Many experts have pointed out that when training fighting sports, the brain extracts several hormones, among which are Dopamine and Adrenaline which help boosting concentration and reduce pain. Training these sport regularly will result in a naturally fit and astrong body as well as a strong-will mind. Muay thai in particular is an ancient form of self-defense in Thailand. Different from boxing, which is only hand to hand combat, Muay Thai uses 8 limbs that are: hands, legs, elbows and knees. Thus, create lethal blow with high precision when practice right. Despite its brutal nature, Muay Thai trainees follow a set of principle that make such sport is so prestigious. In order to train the body, the trainees must have extreme will power because trainees would have to constantly go thrpugh pain in order to hardened their body. They have to be patient because the result comes much later since their start. The great thing about combat sports is that it make the trainees braver since they have to face a practice opponents constantly during thei training. Overall, everything comes with a price, if you are willing to take the risk of being injured, endured extreme pain, be patient enough, you will see the result as your body is stronger, physically aesthetic and a strong mind that is not easily to collapse before any hardship.</p>
